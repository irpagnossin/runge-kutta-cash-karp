# runge-kutta-cash-karp

This is my implementation of a Runge-Kutta-Cash-Karp integrator of 5th order. It was first used to solve Schr√∂dinger equation of semiconductor heterostructures, on my MSc and PhD work. Later, while working at [CEPA](http://cepa.if.usp.br/), it was used in a Learning Object (LO) about harmonic oscillations: see code [here](https://github.com/cepa-usp/AI-0083/blob/master/applet/RungeKuttaCashKarpSolver.as), and the LO itself [here](midia.atp.usp.br/atividades-interativas/AI-0083).
